# ChatBot
Chatbots, are a hot topic and many companies are hoping to develop bots to have natural conversations indistinguishable from human ones, and many are claiming to be using NLP and Deep Learning techniques to make this possible. A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. Chatbots works algorithm that define and interpret to the sentence entered by user. Thus, it processes the text from the user and selects the appropriate response to the text. Since chatbots mimic an actual person, Artificial Intelligence techniques are used to build them. One such technique within AI is Deep Learning which
mimics the human brain. It finds patterns from the training data and uses the same patterns to process new data. There is a lot of techniques and methods about chatbots.
This project concentred to Deep Learning techniques as a Retrieval based neural network and Natural Language Processing methods.




Retrieval based models use a repository of predefined input, pattern, responses and some kind of heuristic to pick an appropriate response based on the input and context. These systems don’t generate any new text, they just pick a response from a fixed set. Due to the repository of handcrafted responses, retrieval-based methods don’t make grammatical mistakes. However, they may be unable to handle unseen cases for which no appropriate predefined response exists. For the same reasons, these models can’t refer back to contextual entity information like names mentioned earlier in the conversation. Retrieval based approaches is more easier for traning process and make less grammatical mistakes than generative based model. For these reasons, I choose the retrieval based models. 

When working with text data, we need to perform various preprocessing on the data before we make a deep learning model. Based on the requirements we need to apply various operations to preprocess the data.

NLP provides to clean up to text data with Lemmazation and Tokenization and other techniques such as Bag of Words etc. This algorithms and functions was used when before training process.

Then, trained the model with successful accuracy. 

Lastly, created the basic GUI because of to communicate the bot and human.
